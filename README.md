# Collatz
These programs both use the simple algorithm of the Collatz conjecture to analyze behavior of numbers in this algorithm, and potentially to find a pattern.

One of the programs sees how high certain numbers explode up to be, and the other one counts how many iterations of the algorithm are required to reach 1.
